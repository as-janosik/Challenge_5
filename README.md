# Challenge_5

## Description

This was built to provide a quick quiz of some of the basics to Javascript.  Displaying interval timer, dynamic buttons with logic behind to review answer and provide feedback.  In the js file we are using an array object to help populate each question after users input.  Implemented a increment counter per button click to avoid going out of bounds with the question array.
